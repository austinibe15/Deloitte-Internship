## Deloitte Virtual Internship
This repository showcases my submission for the Deloitte STEM Virtual Program. Throughout the program, I had the opportunity to assist Daikibo Industrials, a global leader in heavy machinery manufacturing, with a variety of challenges they are currently facing.

## Task 01 - Coding
As part of their integration of IIoT (Industrial Internet-of-Things) devices, Daikibo is in the process of monitoring, measuring, and analyzing their manufacturing processes. However, their infrastructure uses two different formats for streaming telemetry data. They require assistance in merging these two files.

By completing this task, I gained experience in manipulating JSON files using Python and utilized the unittest framework to write and execute tests for Python code.

## Task 02 - Data Analysis
Daikibo's tech team has converted the telemetry data collected from the company's four factories:

Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)
Each location operates nine types of machines, which transmit messages every 10 minutes. Daikibo has collected this data for one month (May 2021) and shared it in a single JSON file. The purpose of collecting this telemetry data was to address two questions:

Which location experienced the highest number of machine breakdowns?
Which specific machines experienced the most frequent breakdowns in that location?
Completing this task enabled me to utilize the renowned analytics tool Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that assists Daikibo's tech team in answering these questions.

## Task 03 - Development
While analyzing offline data is valuable, having a real-time overview of processes and receiving intelligent alerts when issues arise is even more beneficial. Daikibo's tech team has requested the development of a real-time manufacturing status dashboard. The first step in this process is to draft a development proposal.

By completing this task, I acquired the skills to create a concise and compelling software development proposal.

## Task 04 - Cyber Security
Due to a major news publication revealing sensitive private information of Daikibo Industrials, a production problem has caused their assembly lines to halt, posing a threat to the smooth operation of supply chains dependent on Daikibo's products. The client suspects a potential breach in the security of their new status board.

By completing this task, I gained proficiency in reading web log files and identifying suspicious requests. It is worth noting that the dashboard is hosted on Daikibo's Intranet, and remote access is only possible through VPN tunneling. Upon analyzing the web log file, I observed that the user with the IP address 192.168.0.101 initially initiated a regular login and dashboard browsing. However, it then transformed into an automated check of the statuses in all four factories, occurring once per hour, without any page resources being loaded, and exhibiting obvious non-human punctuality.

## Task 05 - Forensic Technology
In response to a concerning number of internal complaints regarding gender inequality in terms of pay, Daikibo Industrials has sought our assistance in conducting an investigation. The Forensic Tech team has developed an algorithm to quantify the "level of gender pay equality" across various job roles within the company and across all company locations.

Completing this task allowed me to refresh my knowledge of Excel functions and apply them effectively in the investigation process.
